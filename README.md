#Cryptocurrency Clustering Analysis

#Overview

This project analyzes cryptocurrency market data using K-Means clustering with and without Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The analysis helps identify patterns in cryptocurrency price movements and group similar cryptocurrencies together.
Features

Data preprocessing and standardization
K-Means clustering implementation
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Interactive visualizations using hvPlot
Comparative analysis of clustering results

Key Findings

PCA reduced dimensions while preserving 89.50% of data variance
Clustering with PCA showed more distinct cryptocurrency groupings
The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method

Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
hvPlot
StandardScaler
KMeans
PCA

Note
This project was developed with assistance from open-source AI language modules to help write and optimize the code structure and implementation.
